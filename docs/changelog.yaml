releases:
  - name: 'v0.0.1-a07'
    date: '2023-07-04'
    notice:
      Idiomatic separate cmake files for each library. Fix a lot of compile warnings. Improve doxygen
      documentation.
    repos:
      datagram-transport-c:
        breaking:
          - '`datagramTransportMultiReceiveFrom()` return `ssize_t` instead of
            `int`. $6c3d3b9'

      time-tick-c:
        improved:
          - 'Smoother ticks. As long as possible, do one tick for each update
            (does not work if update rate is a lot higher or lower than the target tick
            rate). #1'

      nimble-engine-client:
        removed:
          - remove unused field `isHostingLocally`

      secure-random-c:
        workaround:
          - 'halt execution (`SIGABRT`) in `secureRandomUInt64()` on Emscripten. #2'

  - name: 'v0.0.1-a06'
    date: '2023-06-22'
    notice: Minor compile fixes for emscripten.
    repos:
      clog:
        fixed:
          - use `tc_snprintf` instead of `sprintf` (#1)

      secure-random-c:
        workaround:
          - '`secureRandomUInt64()` on emscripten that only return 0'

  - name: 'v0.0.1-a05'
    date: '2023-06-14'
    notice: Hot fixes to alleviate skip ahead problems.
    repos:
      nimble-engine-client:
        changed:
          - Increase wait time between each skip ahead attempt

      nimble-server-lib:
        changed:
          - Skip increase forcedStepInRowCounter if client transport connection
            is downloading game state

  - name: 'v0.0.1-a04'
    date: '2023-05-17'
    notice: Focus on disconnect detection on client and server.
    repos:
      hazy-c:
        added:
          - Add `hazyDatagramTransportDebugDiscardIncoming()`. Discards all
            incoming datagrams. Only used for debugging.
        changed:
          - Make worst case configuration a bit nicer. Reduce max jitter from 31
            to 6, and decrease worst latency to 190 from 220.

      nimble-client-c:
        added:
          - Check for disconnect on client. If not gotten any valid datagrams
            for X (10) ticks or if no new authoritative steps encountered for Y
            (20) ticks, the connection is disconnected.
          - Impending disconnect warning. Is triggered if connection is close to
            being disconnected. If triggered it will stay on for 20
            ticks.  Useful for displaying in an application HUD.
          - Dropping datagram warning. If triggered it will stay on for 20
            ticks.  Useful for displaying in an application HUD.

      nimble-engine-client:
        added:
          - Small gap in time interval warning for incoming authoritative steps.
            If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks. Useful for displaying in
            an application HUD.
          - Big gap in time interval warning for incoming authoritative steps.
            If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks.

      nimble-server-lib:
        added:
          - Check for disconnects on the server. If steps haven't been received
            for 120 authoritative step compositions in a row, or if predicted
            steps frequently is not received in time, the client is
            disconnected.
        breaking:
          - Change from `nbd` prefix for functions to `nimbleServer`.
        refactored:
          - file `req_step.c` split up into multiple files.
        fixed:
          - Connection index compare against participant connections instead of
            transport connections.

      nimble-steps-c:
        fixed:
          - nbsPendingStepRanges should close last range properly
        tests:
          - Add test for receive mask and step ranges.
        refactored:
          - Move receive mask calculation to separate logic file and struct.

    repos:
      datagram-transport-c:
        added:
          - udp transport changed name to datagram transport, to clarify that it
            is an interface and not directly tied to UDP
        changed:
          - datagram transport receive now returns `ssize_t`.

      flood-c:
        fixed:
          - soft error instead of execution halt for failed verification of
            markers.

      hazy-c:
        added:
          - use new datagram transport.
        fixed:
          - log instead of halting on buffer overflow.
        changed:
          - tweaked values for good, recommended and worst case.

      monotonic-time-c:
        fixed:
          - suspicious lower bits diff is now a soft error and does not halt
            execution.

      nimble-client-c:
        added:
          - use new datagram transport
          - Lagometer. A sliding window with latency and drop information for
            each packet received.

      nimble-engine-client:
        added:
          - use new datagram transport.
        fixed:
          - use time tick to handle cases where update was called too
            frequently.
          - check for overflow of predicted buffer.
          - temporary skip ahead. There is still a bug where it sometimes can
            not skip ahead, but this fix might help with some cases.

      nimble-server-lib:
        added:
          - use multi transport
        breaking:
          - renamed some of the function name prefix from nbd to nimble server.
            Makes it eaiser to understand where the code is coming from.
        docs:
          - clarify forced step in documentation.

      seer-c:
        changed:
          - rename to participantId instead of index.
