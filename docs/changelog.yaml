    notice: Focus on disconnect detection on client and server.
    modules:
      - name: hazy-c
        added:
          - Add `hazyDatagramTransportDebugDiscardIncoming()`. Discards all incoming datagrams. Only used for debugging.
        changes:
          - Make worst case configuration a bit nicer. Reduce max jitter from 31 to 6, and decrease worst latency to 190 from 220.

      - name: nimble-client-c
        added:
          - Check for disconnect on client. If not gotten any valid datagrams for X (10) ticks or if no new authoritative steps encountered for Y (20) ticks, the connection is disconnected.
          - Impending disconnect warning. Is triggered if connection is close to being disconnected. If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks.  Useful for displaying in an application HUD.
          - Dropping datagram warning. If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks.  Useful for displaying in an application HUD.

      - name: nimble-engine-client
        added:
          - Small gap in time interval warning for incoming authoritative steps. If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks. Useful for displaying in an application HUD.
          - Big gap in time interval warning for incoming authoritative steps. If triggered it will stay on for 20 ticks.

      - name: nimble-server-lib
        added:
          - Check for disconnects on the server. If steps haven't been received for 120 authoritative step compositions in a row, or if predicted steps frequently is not received in time, the client is disconnected.
        breaking:
          - Change from `nbd` prefix for functions to `nimbleServer`.
        refactored:
          - file `req_step.c` split up into multiple files.
        fixes:
          - Connection index compare against participant connections instead of transport connections.

      - name: nimble-steps-c
        fixes:
          - nbsPendingStepRanges should close last range properly
        tests:
          - Add test for receive mask and step ranges.
        refactored:
          - Move receive mask calculation to separate logic file and struct.
